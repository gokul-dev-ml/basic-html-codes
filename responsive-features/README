## 🧠 Implementation Overview

This project implements a **responsive Features section UI** using **HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4**. The layout is designed with a **mobile-first approach**, ensuring consistent behavior across screen sizes while maintaining readability and visual hierarchy.

---

## 📐 Layout Architecture

The layout follows Bootstrap’s recommended grid structure:

* `.container` → centers content and applies responsive padding
* `.row` → creates a horizontal group for columns
* `.col-12 col-md-4` →

  * **Mobile (≤768px):** 1 feature per row
  * **Desktop (≥768px):** 3 features per row

This ensures the UI scales naturally without media queries.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-md-4">...</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 🧩 Feature Card Structure

Each feature card contains:

* An icon image
* A heading describing the feature
* A paragraph explaining the feature

This structure is repeated consistently to maintain visual balance and predictable scanning patterns.

---

## 🎨 Styling Strategy

### Typography

* **Roboto** is used for all text to ensure readability and modern appearance
* Headings use heavier font weight to establish hierarchy
* Paragraph text uses muted colors to reduce visual noise

```css
.heading {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: "Roboto";
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #1f2933;
}
```

---

### Image Consistency

Icons are constrained to fixed dimensions to avoid layout shifts and ensure uniform spacing across all feature cards.

```css
.logo {
  height: 60px;
  width: 60px;
}
```

---

### Text Readability & Wrapping

Paragraphs are intentionally constrained in width to improve reading comfort and prevent overly long lines on large screens.

```css
.paragraph {
  max-width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}
```

**Why this matters:**

* Improves readability
* Prevents text overflow from long words
* Keeps feature cards visually aligned

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

* Uses **Bootstrap grid utilities** instead of custom media queries
* Automatically adapts layout based on viewport width
* Maintains alignment and spacing on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🧠 Design Decisions Explained

| Decision            | Reason                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Bootstrap Grid      | Reliable, industry-standard responsive system    |
| Mobile-first layout | Better accessibility and UX                      |
| Fixed icon size     | Prevents uneven card heights                     |
| Max-width text      | Enhances readability                             |
| No JavaScript logic | Keeps the component lightweight and maintainable |
