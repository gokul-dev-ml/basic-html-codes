🛍️ VR Products – Responsive Feature Cards

This project implements a responsive product showcase section for VR devices using Bootstrap 4 and custom CSS. The layout is designed to highlight product visuals while keeping key information and actions clearly accessible across all screen sizes.

🧱 Layout & Responsiveness

The section is built using Bootstrap’s grid system:

Mobile devices: Product cards stack vertically for optimal readability.

Medium screens: Cards adjust into balanced columns.

Large screens: Two product cards are displayed side by side for efficient use of horizontal space.

Bootstrap utility classes handle spacing and alignment without relying on fixed layouts.

🖼️ Product Card Structure

Each product is represented by a full-height visual card that uses a background image rather than an <img> element. This allows text and buttons to be overlaid directly on the image.

Each card contains:

Product title

Price information

Primary call-to-action button

Content is aligned to the bottom of the card to maintain a consistent visual hierarchy.

🎨 Background Image Handling

Custom CSS controls background rendering for the product cards:

background-size: cover ensures the image fills the card area proportionally.

background-position: center keeps the focal point centered.

Fixed height provides visual consistency between cards.

This approach creates immersive product visuals without layout shifts.

📐 Content Alignment

Flexbox is used to align text and buttons within each card:

display: flex and flex-direction: column organize content vertically.

justify-content: flex-end anchors content to the bottom of the card.

Internal padding ensures readable spacing from the edges.

✍️ Typography & Styling

Google Fonts provide consistent, modern typography.

White text ensures strong contrast against background images.

Buttons are styled with borders and rounded corners to maintain visual clarity.

🔘 Action Buttons

Each product card includes a “Buy Now” button styled to match the overall theme.

A separate “View All” button is positioned below the cards and aligned to the right using Flexbox utilities, making it easily discoverable without distracting from the main content.

🎯 Design Consistency

Consistent card dimensions across products

Unified color palette and typography

Clear visual hierarchy between title, price, and action

✅ Result

Fully responsive product showcase

Clean, modern UI with immersive visuals

Reusable and scalable layout

Suitable for landing pages, e-commerce sections, and portfolio projects

This implementation demonstrates effective use of Bootstrap grid utilities, Flexbox alignment, and CSS background images to create a polished and maintainable UI component.
