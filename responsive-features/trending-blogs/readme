📌 Trending Blogs – Responsive Card Layout

This project implements a responsive “Trending Blogs” section using Bootstrap 4 and custom CSS. The layout is designed to adapt smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes while maintaining a clean and modern visual hierarchy.

🧱 Layout Structure

The section is wrapped inside a Bootstrap container and organized using a single row.

The grid system is used to control how content behaves at different breakpoints.

Mobile & Tablet: Cards stack vertically for readability.

Desktop (lg and above): Cards are displayed side by side in two columns.

<div class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">

🖼️ Card Design

Each blog item is represented as a card component consisting of:

A featured image

Category label

Blog title/description

“Read More” call-to-action

The card content is wrapped inside a .card container to ensure consistent spacing and alignment.

✨ Visual Depth with Shadows

Bootstrap’s shadow utility is applied to the card container to add depth and visual separation from the background:

<div class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6 shadow">

This provides a subtle elevation effect that improves content focus without overwhelming the design.

🎯 Image Handling

Images are styled to maintain consistent height and align cleanly within each card:

.image {

    height: 190px;

    width: auto;

}

This ensures:

Uniform appearance across cards

Proper scaling on different screen sizes

Clean alignment with card content

✍️ Typography & Content Styling

Custom typography enhances readability and hierarchy:

Section heading emphasizes the page context.

Category text uses muted colors to differentiate metadata.

Main paragraph text is larger and bolder to draw attention.

Read More text uses color contrast and cursor styling to indicate interactivity.

🔗 Interactive Elements

The “Read More” text is styled to behave like an interactive link:

.readmore {

    cursor: pointer;

}

This improves usability by providing a clear visual cue for user interaction.

📐 Button Alignment

The “View All” button is positioned using Flexbox utilities:

<div class="d-flex justify-content-end">

This keeps the button aligned to the right on larger screens while remaining responsive on smaller devices.

🎨 Design Consistency

Google Fonts ensure consistent typography across the section.

A minimal color palette maintains a professional and modern look.

Rounded corners and shadows create a polished UI appearance.

✅ Result

Responsive, grid-based layout

Clean and structured card components

Visual depth through shadows

Clear typography and interaction cues

Suitable for production use and portfolio projects

This implementation demonstrates effective use of Bootstrap’s grid system, utility classes, and custom CSS to build a scalable and maintainable UI component.
