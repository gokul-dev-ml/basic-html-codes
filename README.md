# basic-html-codes
This basic full-stack web project is built to practice end-to-end web development fundamentals. It includes a simple frontend UI connected to backend APIs and supports CRUD  operations. The focus is on understanding frontend–backend communication, request–response flow, and basic data handling rather than production-level features.
