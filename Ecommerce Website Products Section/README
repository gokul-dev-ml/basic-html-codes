📦 Responsive Products Section with Modals – Bootstrap 4

📌 Overview

This project implements a responsive “Our Products” section for an e-commerce website using Bootstrap 4, custom CSS, and Bootstrap Modals.

It displays product cards with background images and opens detailed product information in modals when users click “View Details”.

The layout is optimized for mobile-first responsiveness and follows Bootstrap best practices.

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

Bootstrap 4.5.2

Google Fonts (Roboto & others)

🧭 Layout Structure

1️⃣ Container & Grid System

Uses Bootstrap’s container → row → column structure

Responsive layout achieved with:

col-12 → mobile view

col-md-6 → desktop view (2-column layout)

<div class="col-12 col-md-6">

2️⃣ Section Header

Product section title spans full width

<h1>Our Products</h1>

Styled using custom typography and spacing.

3️⃣ Product Cards

Each product is displayed as a card with a background image, product name, description, and action button.

✔ Cards stack vertically on mobile

✔ Cards appear side-by-side on desktop

✔ Content aligned at the bottom using Flexbox

<div class="card image d-flex flex-column justify-content-end">

4️⃣ Background Images

Product images are applied using CSS for better layout control.

.image {

  background-image: url("headphones-bg.png");

  background-size: cover;

  background-position: center;

}

A separate class (image2) is used for the second product.

🎞️ Modal Implementation

Each product card opens a Bootstrap modal with detailed information.

🔹 Modal Trigger

<button

  data-toggle="modal"

  data-target="#headphoneModal">

  View Details

</button>

🔹 Modal Features

✔ Modals are placed outside the grid (best practice)
