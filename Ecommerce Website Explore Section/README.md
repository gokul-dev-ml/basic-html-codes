🧩 Features

Fully responsive card layout

Uses Bootstrap grid (col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4)

Equal-height cards using h-100

Proper image centering and scaling

Clean separation of HTML and CSS

Mobile-first design approach

🧠 Key Design Decisions

1. Responsive Grid (No Fixed Widths)

Cards use width: 100% instead of fixed pixel values, ensuring:

No overflow on tablets

Proper alignment on all breakpoints

2. Equal Height Cards

Using:

<div class="secondcard shadow h-100">

ensures all cards align evenly within the row.

3. Image Alignment

Images are centered using:

class="d-block mx-auto"

which works reliably across browsers.

4. Spacing & Alignment

Bootstrap spacing utilities (mb-4, pl-3, pt-3) are used instead of hardcoded margins to keep the layout flexible.
